#After the package has been accepted, I should DELETE 
# CRAN-SUBMISSION 
# UNLESS I USE 
# usethis::use_github_release(), 
# because then IT is supposed to delete this temporary file.
# 
# usethis::use_github_release() creates release notes 
# from the NEWS bullets relevant to the current release. 
# Note that usethis::use_github_release() depends crucially 
# on the CRAN-SUBMISSION file that was written by 
# devtools::submit_cran(): thatâ€™s how it knows which SHA to tag. 
# After the successful creation of the GitHub release, 
# use_github_release() deletes this temporary file.
